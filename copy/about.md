About Assured Roofing
Trusted Local Roofers Dedicated to Quality, Safety, and Service

Our Story
Assured Roofing was founded with a simple mission: to deliver reliable, high-quality roofing solutions that homeowners and property developers can trust. As a proud family-run business based in Dorset, we’ve built our reputation on craftsmanship, honesty, and a genuine commitment to protecting the homes in our community.
What started as a small local service has grown into one of the most trusted roofing teams in Bournemouth, Christchurch, and Poole. Our experienced roofers bring decades of combined expertise to every project — from small residential repairs to large-scale developments — and we treat every property as if it were our own.

Built on Quality and Trust
At Assured Roofing, we believe that a roof is more than just a structure — it’s peace of mind. That’s why we focus on delivering workmanship of the highest standard, using only quality materials and proven techniques to ensure your roof stands the test of time.
Safety is at the heart of everything we do. Our team follows strict industry standards and best practices on every job, ensuring your property is protected and the work is carried out responsibly and efficiently. We’re fully insured, accredited, and committed to transparent communication from the first survey to the final inspection.
